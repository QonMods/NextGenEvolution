Version: 1.2.0
  Info:
    - Updated for Factorio v1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
  Features:
    - NGE tracks evolution factor changes statistics from the different sources from now on.
    - New command /ngevolution works like /evolution but shows how much each factor (vanilla and NGE)
      has contributed to the total evolution.
      The accuracy of the values reported haven't been tested yet, but the statistics collection
      exists now at least so I wanted to get that out now.
      Thanks to kaldskryke and Solinya for [requesting](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/NextGenEvolution/discussion/5e8a3d4103ee8c000c72e41d)
      this feature!

  Info:
    - Updated for Factorio v0.18

Version: 0.0.4
  Changes:
    - The mod now only runs once/minute instead of per second. It was running every second for debug
      purposes but it isn't really necessary if you aren't checking your evolution every second so
      it was changed. Now it should actually be 0 performance impact now that the debugging stuff is gone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.3
  Changes:
    - The presets now start with the vanilla pollution evolution factor 0 instead of 9 (or instead of 12 for death worlds).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Now should support evolution factor when there are multiple forces killing the natives.
  Changes:
    - Uses the API that was fixed in [0.17.39] https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=70801
    - Code cleanup and refactoring.
    - New default values for the different evolution sources.
      Should be somewhat comparable in balance as default settings in vanilla if you set evolution
      due to pollution produced (vanilla map gen settings > enemy > evolution) in map gen settings.
      So it is suggested you turn that to 0 and rely on this mod to evolve them from pollution. But you
      can use both if you want of course.
